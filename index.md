This portfolio is a compilation of my personal projects that focus on exploratory data analysis, applied machine learning, statistics, and software engineering.

## Stand-alone Projects

These are creative projects that were created to satisfy my machine learning itch. Each project is designed to address a real-world problem that relevant to my passion and pursuit of learning. 

### The Faces of Reddit

This is a project that involve the application of computer visions method such as facial detection and facial landmarks construction. The project is set out to create an average face for a set of images from a community. For example, the images from each subReddit were used to generate an average face that represent the average facial features of the given subReddit.

### IOT Monitor Environment Data

A interactive dashboard application that monitor the condition of my room in real-time. The main functions of this application include:

* Monitor the temperature, pressure, light, color and accelerometer data

* Detect anomaly in the system's temperature

* Provide analytics about energy usage using historical data

## Classification Problems

These are projects that aim to solve enterprise problem using structured data. Some projects were part of Kaggle competitions.

### Detect Fraud from Customer Transactions

Researchers from the IEEE Computational Intelligence Society (IEEE-CIS) presented a challenge regarding improving the accuracy of fraud prevention system in order to improve customer experience in banking services. In this competition, I benchmark machine learning models on a challenging large-scale dataset. There is a lot of data about users behavior and potential patterns for detecting fraud. Here's my [kernel](https://www.kaggle.com/suoires1/fraud-detection-eda-and-modeling).

### MNIST Digit Recognition

MNIST Digit Recognition is a knowledge competition on Kaggle. Many people started practicing in machine learning with this competition, so did I. This is a multiple classification problem: based on the data image of a given digit, predict which number is corresponded with the given input. This dataset provides an interesting opportunity to learn about models comparison and feature engineering. Here's my [kernel](https://www.kaggle.com/suoires1/mnist-a-gentle-introduction-to-classification).
